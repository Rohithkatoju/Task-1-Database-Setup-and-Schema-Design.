Hi Team, 

As part of the task given ot intern, I interested in Schema of Lirary. As I have little knowledge, how library management works unlike an entities in commerce.
I want to elaborate the process in the step-by procedure.

step-1 : Open MySQL Command-Line or Workbench

step-2 : Create the Database (Library)

I have created the database and named as Library, 

step-3 : Select the Database

step-4 : Create Tables One by One

I have created the several tables related to or managed in Library management schema, the following tables are

(Authors, Publisher, Books, Members, Borrow_records) as they are essenissal required data for the smooth handling in Library Management.

The Library Management System consists of six main tables, each serving a specific purpose:

The Authors table stores the names of book authors along with their biographies.

The Publisher table holds information about publishing companies, including their names and addresses.

The Books table contains details about each book, such as its title, genre, total copies, and references to its author and publisher.

The Members table keeps records of individuals who are registered to borrow books from the library.

The Borrow_Records table tracks the borrowing activity, showing which member borrowed which book, along with dates and any fines.
